\textbf{RQ1:} & How much more concise, readable, and precise with respect to handwritten examples are the snippets after summarization? \\
\textbf{RQ2:} & Do more powerful clustering techniques, that cluster similar rather than identical sequences, lead to snippets that more closely match handwritten examples? \\
\textbf{RQ3:} & Does our tool mine more diverse patterns than other existing approaches? \\
\textbf{RQ4:} & Do snippets match handwritten examples more than API call sequences? \\
